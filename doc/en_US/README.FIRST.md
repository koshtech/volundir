## About [:Volundir]

[:Volundir] is a curated ecosystem of Kosh’s ideas — engineered to deliver a lightweight, agnostic, modular, and extensible Vanilla JavaScript framework.

At its core, [:Volundir][:JS] provides a structured yet flexible foundation for building modern applications without external dependencies. Complementing it, [:Volundir][:UI] delivers an in-house UI Kit designed for clarity, consistency, and rapid interface composition.

The ecosystem also includes [:Volundir][:PWA], a cross-platform Progressive Web App server and builder, enabling seamless deployment across environments. For quality assurance, [:Volundir][:vSpec] offers a complete and integrated testing system.

Together, these components — along with a suite of Kosh-styled development tools — create a Rails-inspired JavaScript development experience, focused on building and deploying Cross Progressive Web Applications with elegance, control, and performance.
